		<h1>The Evolution of Bicycle</h1>
		<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster. Two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.</p>
